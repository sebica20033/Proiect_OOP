OOP Coding Project

The app is projected for managing the flows. It has two main functionalities: creating a new flow and going through an already existing one with predifined steps. These predifined steps are initialized when a flow is created. To see how the code is running, download all the files in one place, open the ".cpp" file in a code editor and run it. There will be all the informations that you need to understand how it goes.
